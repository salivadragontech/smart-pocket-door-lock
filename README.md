# Smart Pocket Door Lock
+ Control the door lock with a servo motor **without disassemble the door lock.**
+ In the event of a device failure, the door can still be easily opened with a key.

## File
+ **`/3d_model`** : 3D model for controlling the door lock.
+ **`/arduino`** : Code for Arduino.
+ **`/raspi`** : Files in Raspberry Pi.

## Known issues
1. May require additional control chip to control multiple servo motors, otherwise it will be very unstable.
